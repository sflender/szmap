szmap - a fast C++ code for generating a mock tSZ map from a halo catalog
by Samuel Flender

Added beta profile by Vinu Vikraman


currently the code is using the pressure profile from Battaglia+12 (arxiv 1109.3711) & Birkinshaw 1999

You need to install Healpix, cfitsio, MPI, and gsl. To compile, type "make". To run, type "./szmap szmap.cfg".

The config parameters are:

profiletype = 1/2 for Battaglia/Beta
order = order of the Healpix map
order_subpix = if this is larger than order, then each pixel is subpixelized into pixels of the higher order. This can reduce some shotnoise at very high ell.
convert_map_to_ring = Set this to 1 if you want to have the output map in RING ordering (otherwise NESTED)
write_output_file = 1 for writing output file
output_tsz_name = name of the output file
cluster_catalog = name of the cluster catalog
nu = frequency for converting y to T

Cosmology parameters:
h, Omega_M, Omega_b, Omega_k, w_DE

max_int_radius = radius out to which to integrate the pressure profile.
trunc_radius = where to truncate the 2D SZ signal. This should be smaller than max_int_radius.

beta = Beta value in the profile

Mmin = lower mass cut
Mmax = upper mass cut
zmin = lower z cut
zmax = upper z cut
